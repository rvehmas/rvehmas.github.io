    "# üéµ Triads: How Three Notes Find Each Other\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine placing your finger on the piano‚Äôs middle **C** key. That is your home base, also called the **root note**. Moving on the piano is simple: a **semitone** means moving to the **next key**, whether black or white.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let‚Äôs ‚Äúbuild a story‚Äù on top of C. Look two keys ahead ‚Äî skip one and play the next. You‚Äôve just added a new character: the **third**. If you move **4** semitones, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúmajor‚Äù third; if **3**, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúminor‚Äù third.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Add one more using the same idea: again, skip one and take the next. This gives you the **fifth**. Together these three form a **triad**: root + third + fifth. Skipping a key not only makes the fingering natural, it also tells your ear that the notes ‚Äúbelong together.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Major and Minor by Ear\n",
    "\n",
    "When the third above C is ‚Äúmajor‚Äù (4 semitones) followed by a ‚Äúminor‚Äù (3 semitones), the chord is **major**. It sounds bright and stable: **C‚ÄìE‚ÄìG**. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the order is reversed (3 + 4), you get **minor**. It's softer and more wistful: **C‚ÄìE‚ô≠‚ÄìG**. In both cases the fifth lies 7 semitones above the root, anchoring the chord firmly.\n",
    "\n",
    "On an equal-tempered piano these come from simple frequency ratios. If the root frequency is $f_0$, then $f_{\\text{third}} = f_0 \\cdot 2^{\\,n_{\\text{third}}/12}$ and  $f_{\\text{fifth}} = f_0 \\cdot 2^{\\,n_{\\text{fifth}}/12}.$ For major, $n_{\\text{third}} = 4$; for minor, $n_{\\text{third}} = 3$; and for the fifth, $n_{\\text{fifth}} = 7$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: C Major on the Piano\n",
    "\n",
    "Start from **C** and play **every other white key**: C‚ÄìE‚ÄìG. The pitches relative to C follow simple multipliers: $f_{\\text{E}} \\approx f_0 \\cdot 2^{4/12} \\;(\\text{about }1.26 \\times f_0)$, $f_{\\text{G}} \\approx f_0 \\cdot 2^{7/12} \\;(\\text{about }1.50 \\times f_0).$ With **C4 ‚âà 261.63 Hz**, you get $\\text{E4} \\approx 329.63\\,\\text{Hz}$ and $\\text{G4} \\approx 392.00\\,\\text{Hz}.$\n",

    "\n",
    "If you move up the scale and build a triad on **every note** with the 1‚Äì3‚Äì5 rule (using only white keys), you‚Äôll notice the story shifts slightly from one chord to the next:\n",
    "\n",
    "- On C you get **C‚ÄìE‚ÄìG** (major),  \n",

    "## üìú A Short Historical Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "The story goes that **Pythagoras** (c. 500 BCE) experimented with strings of different lengths. When a string is plucked, its vibration sets the air in motion, creating a sound wave. He noticed something profound:  \n",
    "- Halving the length of the string made the pitch an **octave higher**.  \n",
    "- A string **2/3 the length** gave a **perfect fifth**.  \n",
    "- A string **3/4 the length** gave a **perfect fourth**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because string length is directly proportional to **wavelength**, these simple length ratios translate into simple **frequency ratios**. This was the birth of *harmonic ratios* ‚Äî the mathematical skeleton of music. üé∂‚ú®\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ü§î Why Do Some Intervals Please Us?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does a major triad sound bright, while a tritone (augmented fourth, about 45/32 in just intonation) often sounds jarring or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù?  \n",
    "\n",
    "One idea comes from **evolution**. Regular, repeating patterns are easier for the brain to **predict and process**. When two notes form a small-integer ratio, their combined waveform repeats quickly, giving the ear a sense of stability. That ‚Äúlock-in‚Äù feels smooth and consonant.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **tritone**, however, is different. Its ratio does not reduce to small whole numbers, so the combined waveform never settles into a neat repeating cycle. To the brain, this sounds **chaotic**, unstable, and unresolved. Historically, it was even called *diabolus in musica* ‚Äî ‚Äúthe devil in music.‚Äù üòà\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üî¨ Scientific Perspectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern research offers several lenses:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Auditory physiology:** The inner ear decomposes sound into frequencies using the basilar membrane. When harmonics line up (like in a fifth), the vibrations reinforce each other. When they don‚Äôt, they create **beats** and roughness.  \n",
    "- **Neuroscience:** Brain scans show that consonant intervals activate the brain‚Äôs **reward circuits** more strongly, suggesting that harmonic simplicity literally feels good.  \n",
    "- **Information theory:** Some researchers argue that music reflects a balance of **predictability and surprise**. Too much order is boring; too much chaos is noise. Intervals and chords that strike the right balance grab our attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üåå The Remaining Mysteries\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, not everything is explained. Why do we get **goosebumps** from a well-placed chord change? Why do some cultures embrace intervals others find dissonant? Why can a dissonance in one context sound ugly, but in another (say, jazz) sound rich and expressive?  \n",
    "\n",
    "The science of waves and ratios explains *part* of the picture. But the deeper question ‚Äî why vibrations in the air connect so deeply to human emotion ‚Äî remains partly a mystery. And maybe that‚Äôs the most beautiful part of all. ‚ú®\n"
