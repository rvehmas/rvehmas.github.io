    "# The Discovery of Electromagnetic Waves and Radar üì°\n",
    "\n",
    "Radar engineers have a special fondness for waves. Those beautifully oscillating, rippling, and soothing shapes that underpin our craft. Nearly 200 years ago, two brilliant minds had a radical idea: what if electric forces could travel through space as waves? üåä‚ö°\n",
    "\n",
    "These pioneers were none other than **Michael Faraday** and **James Clerk Maxwell**, the architects of classical electromagnetic theory. Maxwell, in particular, gave us the mathematical blueprint for these waves, though his ideas were ahead of their time. Many of their peers in the mid 19th century struggled to grasp their significance. Even the esteemed **Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)** dismissed some of Maxwell's ideas as lapsing into mysticism! üßô\n",
    "\n",
    "## The First Experiments üßë‚Äçüî¨\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast forward a few decades, and **Heinrich Hertz** finally provided experimental proof that **electromagnetic waves** were real. He generated them by using an oscillating electric spark ‚ö°. With curved metal plates as simple reflectors, he demonstrated that these waves could be generated, reflected, and detected. This electrifying discovery not only confirmed the existence of electromagnetic waves but also laid the foundation for wireless communication and radar technology. üì°\n",
    "\n",
    "The British often take credit for making **radar** an operational capability in the lead-up to World War II. However, the concept of radar predates the war by several decades. The first known patent for a radar-like system was actually filed in the early 1900s by a German inventor, **Christian H√ºlsmeyer**. However, his <a href=\"https://www.radarworld.org/huelsmeyer.html\" target=\"_blank\">*telemobiloscope*</a> was likely not a true **radar**, as there is no clear evidence that it could measure target distances (a crucial aspect of radar, which is defined as radio detection and *ranging*). üìè\n",
    "\n",
    "A more definitive experiment demonstrating radar principles occurred across the Atlantic. In **1925**, American physicists **Gregory Breit and Merle Tuve** used a radio transmitter and receiver to measure the height of the ionosphere along the Potomac river near Washington D. C. Though their <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.28.554\" target=\"_blank\">work</a> was revolutionary, the tale of two scientists bouncing radio signals off the sky isn't quite as gripping as wartime espionage and radar battles! ‚úàÔ∏èüí•\n",
    "\n",
    "World War II, however, turned radar from clever experiments into a matter of survival. Suddenly there was an urgent need to spot enemy aircraft **before the bombs fell**, which sparked a race to build effective systems. In fact, radar was being developed independently in nearly all major countries involved in the war. Probably the most famous of these was **Chain Home** in Britain ‚Äî a vast network of tall radar towers scanning the skies. üè∞üì°üî•\n",
    "\n",
    ">Note: The major British contribution was the development of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavity_magnetron\" target=\"_blank\">cavity magnetron</a> ‚Äîa technology that allowed early microradars to transmit more power and see further. It was used in RAF <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_fighter\" target=\"_blank\">night fighter</a> squadrons and, being highly classified, the British government made up a story that the pilots had great night vision due to eating lots of carrots ü•ïü•ï. The saying that \"eating carrots is good for your eyesight\" is now common around the world but not many realise its origins are embedded in the history of radar.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are Electromagnetic Waves? ‚ö°„Ä∞Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of radar are **electromagnetic waves**, which make it possible to map the world around us. The human visual system has evolved to sense light waves emitted by the Sun and reflected by objects in our surroundings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Radar systems work by sending out pulses of radio waves or microwaves. Like light, these are both forms of electromagnetic waves. The key difference is that their **wavelengths** are about a million times longer! Radars then listen for the **echoes** of the transmitted waves, much like a bat navigating in the dark uses sound waves. ü¶áüì°\n",
    "\n",
    "But what exactly are electromagnetic waves? The surprising answer is: **no one truly knows.** Physicists have developed detailed models describing how electric and magnetic forces propagate and interact, yet the fundamental nature of these forces remains elusive. In fact, almost all physicists will tell you it‚Äôs not their job to explain what things **are**, but rather how things **function**. But let‚Äôs not drift too far into philosophy here. ü§ì\n",
    "\n",
    "## Maxwell‚Äôs Contribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Maxwell's genius lay in transforming physics from a world of tangible, **mechanical interactions** into one governed by **abstract mathematics**. Before him, science favored intuitive models that are easy to visualize with the human brain. Think of **Newton‚Äôs laws**, which describe a world of colliding billiard balls and falling apples. üçèüí°\n",
    "\n",
    "By the 19th century, the mechanical worldview had reached its limits. Scientists had tried to explain **electric forces** using various mechanical models and fluid theories, but all had significant flaws ‚ùå. It took Faraday and Maxwell to break through with their elegant, yet less intuitive, vision of the universe. Their theories (like much of modern physics) describe abstract concepts through **equations** rather than everyday language, making them both powerful and elusive. üé≠\n",
    "\n",
    "But fear not! **Analogies** can help bring these concepts to life. Maxwell himself was a master of analogy when explaining electromagnetic phenomena. We'll use different metaphors throught this material to help build intuition about the **physical principles** of radar. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Waves in Motion ü™¢\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a long, thick **rope** lying on the ground. You pick up one end and start wiggling it up and down. Ripples travel away from your hand along the rope, carrying energy outward. „Ä∞Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "How high the rope rises (and falls) is the **amplitude** of the wave. You need to move your hand more forcefully to increase the height (amplitude) of the wave. How quickly you move your hand up and down determines the **frequency** of the wave, that is how many times it goes up and down per second in a fixed spot on the rope. It also sets the **wavelength**, which is the distance between successive crests (or troughs) along the rope. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the electromagnetic world, the rope is replaced by the invisible fabric of the **electromagnetic field**, and your hand is replaced by oscillating electrons. ‚ö° Just as the ripples in the rope move outward from where you shake it, oscillating electrons send ripples through the electromagnetic field. In empty space these ripples always travel at the same speed: **the speed of light, which is a staggering 300 000 km/s**. ‚ú®üî¶\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have the wiggling rope in mind, try the interactive rope simulation below üë©‚Äçüíª. The wave speed is fixed, so the wavelength is always determined by the frequency (the higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength $ \\lambda $). Use the sliders to adjust the **amplitude** and **frequency**. Notice how increasing the amplitude makes the rope move higher and lower, while increasing the frequency makes more crests fit on the rope without changing the wave‚Äôs speed. „Ä∞Ô∏è\n"

    "### **Phase** ü™¢„Ä∞Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "In our rope analogy, **phase** is a concept that tells us exactly **where** a point on the rope is in its up-and-down motion at a given moment. Is it at the highest **crest**, the lowest **trough**, or somewhere in between?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the rope‚Äôs motion repeats in cycles, we describe phase as an **angle between 0 and 360 degrees**.  \n",
    "- A phase of **0** means the point is right at the starting position (e.g., passing through the middle going upward).  \n",
    "- A phase of **90¬∞** means it‚Äôs at the very top of a crest.  \n",
    "- A phase of **180¬∞** means it‚Äôs passing through the middle going downward, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our rope analogy, the **wave speed** is fixed. If you wiggle your hand faster (**higher frequency**), the ripples get closer together (**shorter wavelength**). If you wiggle slower (**lower frequency**), the ripples spread out (**longer wavelength**). The same idea applies to waves on water and to electromagnetic waves like light, radio signals, and radar pulses: **when the speed is constant, changing the frequency automatically changes the wavelength**.\n",

    "## **What is Radar?** üì°\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally an acronym for **Radio Detection and Ranging**, radar has become a widely recognized term in the English language. At its core, radar is a system that **uses electromagnetic waves to detect objects and determine their distance**. \n",
    "\n",
    "A basic **pulsed radar system** achieves this by transmitting **short bursts** of electromagnetic waves, typically in the **radio or microwave frequency range** (wavelengths from a few centimeters to tens of meters). ‚ö°\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How Radar Measures Distance** üìè\n",
    "When a radar sends out a pulse of electromagnetic waves, part of that energy **bounces back** if it hits an object that conducts electricity. The radar listens for these pulse **echoes** and notes how long it takes for them to return.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because electromagnetic waves travel incredibly fast (at the speed of light), even a tiny delay means the object can be far away.  We also knows the wave had to make a **round trip**: out to the object and then back to the radar again.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, distance equals **velocity multiplied by time**. So, by multiplying the round-trip time by the speed of light, we get the total distance the wave has traveled. Since this distance covers both the outgoing and return paths, the true target distance is **half** of that total. üìè\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Radar Pulse in Flatland** üåçüì°  \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we live in **Flatland**, i.e. a 2D world. In this world, our radar sends out a **short pulse** of electromagnetic energy in all directions, like a ripple from a pebble dropped into a pond üåäüí´.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- On the **left**, you see the pulse üì° spreading outward from the radar in all directions.  \n",
    "- When it reaches the üéØ target, part of the energy bounces back toward the radar.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On the **right**, you see what the radar **actually measures** ‚Äî the strength of the returning electric field (also called **voltage** ‚ö°) at its receiver, plotted against **time** ‚è±Ô∏è.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The first part of the trace is flat ‚ûñ: nothing has returned yet.  \n",
    "- When the reflection arrives, there‚Äôs a sharp **blip** üìà in the signal ‚Äî that‚Äôs the echo from the target.  \n",
    "- The time between sending the pulse and seeing the echo tells us **how far away the target is** üìè.  \n",
